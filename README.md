Now I want to rank the games. Each game should get a score, they be ranked by that score. The ranking should happen in its own file. The scoring works as follows:
1. Games get 50 points if the game includes a fav team.
2. Games get 50 points in a fav team wins.
3. Games get 50 points in a fav team wins by less than 2 points
